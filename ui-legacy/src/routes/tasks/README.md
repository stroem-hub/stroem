# Enhanced Task List Implementation

This document describes the implementation of task 4.1: "Update task list page to use enhanced TaskCard components with pagination".

## What was implemented

### 1. Enhanced Page Loader (`+page.ts`)
- Added support for URL query parameters (page, limit, sort, order, search)
- Integrated with the enhanced tasks API that returns paginated results with statistics
- Added proper error handling and fallback states
- Returns structured data including tasks, pagination info, and query parameters

### 2. Enhanced Task List Page (`+page.svelte`)
- **Replaced simple cards with TaskCard components**: Now uses the enhanced TaskCard component that displays execution statistics, last run info, and status indicators
- **Responsive grid layout**: Uses CSS Grid with responsive breakpoints (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop)
- **Server-side pagination**: Integrated Pagination component with full server-side pagination support
- **URL state management**: All filters, sorting, and pagination state is reflected in the URL and persists across page refreshes
- **Search functionality**: Debounced search input that filters tasks by name and description
- **Sorting controls**: Sort by name, last execution, or success rate in ascending/descending order
- **Loading states**: Shows loading overlay during navigation and data fetching
- **Error handling**: Displays error alerts with retry functionality
- **Empty states**: Different empty states for no tasks vs no search results

### 3. Utility Functions (`lib/utils/index.ts`)
- Created debounce function for search input optimization
- Added other utility functions for future use (throttle, formatRelativeTime, etc.)

### 4. TypeScript Integration
- All components use proper TypeScript interfaces from `lib/types.ts`
- Enhanced task data structure with statistics is fully typed
- Pagination interfaces are properly defined and used throughout

## Features

### URL State Management
- Page number: `?page=2`
- Page size: `?limit=50`
- Sorting: `?sort=name&order=desc`
- Search: `?search=my-task`
- All parameters can be combined and persist across browser navigation

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with responsive grid
- Touch-friendly controls
- Proper spacing and typography across screen sizes

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels for pagination controls
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader friendly status indicators
- Semantic HTML structure

### Performance
- Debounced search to reduce API calls
- Server-side pagination for large datasets
- Efficient URL state management without unnecessary re-renders

## API Integration

The implementation works with the enhanced tasks API endpoint:
- `GET /api/tasks?page=1&limit=25&sort=name&order=asc&search=term`
- Returns paginated response with task statistics
- Supports filtering, sorting, and search on the server side

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers with ES2020+ support
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- Graceful degradation when JavaScript is disabled
