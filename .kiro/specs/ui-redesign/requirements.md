# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves a complete redesign and modernization of the Str√∏m orchestration platform's user interface. The current UI relies heavily on Flowbite components and lacks essential functionality like a dashboard. The new UI will feature custom-built components, a modern design system, enhanced functionality, and improved user experience while maintaining all existing capabilities for task execution and job monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want a comprehensive dashboard that provides an overview of system status, recent activity, and key metrics, so that I can quickly assess the health and performance of the orchestration platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the root path ("/") THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with system overview widgets
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show recent job activity, task execution statistics, and system health indicators
3. WHEN the dashboard displays metrics THEN the system SHALL include visual charts for job success rates, execution times, and resource utilization
4. WHEN the user views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide quick access to frequently used actions like running tasks or viewing recent jobs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a custom component library that replaces all Flowbite dependencies, so that the UI has a consistent design system and reduced external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI is built THEN the system SHALL NOT include any Flowbite packages in the dependencies
2. WHEN components are rendered THEN the system SHALL use only custom-built components with consistent styling
3. WHEN the component library is implemented THEN the system SHALL include reusable components for buttons, cards, tables, forms, modals, and navigation
4. WHEN components are styled THEN the system SHALL use a cohesive design system with consistent colors, typography, and spacing
5. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL support both light and dark themes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved navigation system that provides clear access to all platform features, so that I can efficiently navigate between different sections of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a modern sidebar navigation with clear section labels
2. WHEN the navigation is rendered THEN the system SHALL highlight the current active section
3. WHEN the user navigates THEN the system SHALL provide breadcrumb navigation for deeper pages
4. WHEN the navigation loads THEN the system SHALL include sections for Dashboard, Tasks, Actions, Triggers, Jobs, and Settings
5. WHEN the user is on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a collapsible navigation menu

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced task management capabilities that allow me to view, filter, and execute tasks with improved usability, so that I can efficiently manage workflow operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the tasks page THEN the system SHALL display tasks in a searchable and filterable grid layout
2. WHEN the user searches tasks THEN the system SHALL filter results by name, description, or tags in real-time
3. WHEN the user views a task THEN the system SHALL show detailed information including dependencies, recent executions, and input parameters
4. WHEN the user executes a task THEN the system SHALL provide an improved form interface with input validation and help text
5. WHEN a task is running THEN the system SHALL show real-time execution status and progress indicators

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive job monitoring and management features, so that I can track execution history, view logs, and manage running jobs effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views the jobs page THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive list of all jobs with filtering and sorting capabilities
2. WHEN the user views job details THEN the system SHALL show execution timeline, step-by-step progress, and real-time log streaming
3. WHEN jobs are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide status indicators, execution duration, and success/failure metrics
4. WHEN the user views logs THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting, search functionality, and log level filtering
5. WHEN jobs are running THEN the system SHALL update status and logs in real-time using WebSocket connections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and understand actions and triggers available in the system, so that I can comprehend the workflow capabilities and execute individual actions when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user navigates to the actions page THEN the system SHALL display all available actions with descriptions and parameters
2. WHEN the user views an action THEN the system SHALL show input requirements, output format, and usage examples
3. WHEN the user navigates to the triggers page THEN the system SHALL display all configured triggers with their schedules and associated tasks
4. WHEN the user views triggers THEN the system SHALL show trigger history, next execution times, and enable/disable controls
5. WHEN the user executes an action THEN the system SHALL provide the same execution interface as tasks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive design and accessibility features, so that I can use the platform effectively across different devices and accessibility needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is accessed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL provide responsive layouts that work on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
2. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
3. WHEN the user navigates using keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide full keyboard navigation support
4. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure
5. WHEN the user prefers reduced motion THEN the system SHALL respect motion preferences and provide alternative interactions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved error handling and user feedback, so that I understand system status and can recover from errors effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages with suggested solutions
2. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress indicators
3. WHEN actions are successful THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback with relevant details
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle offline states gracefully and retry failed requests
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields with specific error messages

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a maintainable codebase with proper TypeScript types and component organization, so that the UI can be easily extended and maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL use proper TypeScript interfaces for all props and state
2. WHEN the codebase is organized THEN the system SHALL follow consistent file structure and naming conventions
3. WHEN components are built THEN the system SHALL be modular and reusable across different pages
4. WHEN styles are applied THEN the system SHALL use CSS modules or styled-components for component-scoped styling
5. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL have no TypeScript errors and minimal console warnings
