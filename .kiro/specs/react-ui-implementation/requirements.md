# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a complete React-based user interface for the Strøm orchestration platform to replace the existing SvelteKit implementation. The new UI will provide a modern, responsive dashboard for managing workflows, tasks, and job executions with real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to authenticate with the Strøm platform using existing authentication methods, so that I can securely access the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a login form
2. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate via the existing API endpoints
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL store the JWT token securely
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to the main dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a comprehensive dashboard showing system overview and key metrics, so that I can quickly understand the current state of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display recent job executions
2. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show system status indicators
3. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display task execution statistics
4. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show workspace information
5. WHEN dashboard data updates THEN the system SHALL refresh the display automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a workflow manager, I want to view and manage all available tasks in the system, so that I can understand what workflows are configured and trigger executions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the tasks section THEN the system SHALL display all available tasks
2. WHEN a user views a task THEN the system SHALL show task configuration details
3. WHEN a user selects a task THEN the system SHALL provide an option to execute it manually
4. WHEN a user triggers task execution THEN the system SHALL initiate the job via API
5. WHEN task execution starts THEN the system SHALL provide feedback and redirect to job monitoring

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an operations user, I want to monitor job executions and view their logs, so that I can track progress and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the jobs section THEN the system SHALL display all job executions
2. WHEN a user views job details THEN the system SHALL show execution status and metadata
3. WHEN a user selects a job THEN the system SHALL display real-time logs
4. WHEN job logs update THEN the system SHALL stream new log entries automatically
5. WHEN a job completes THEN the system SHALL update the status and final results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different sections of the application seamlessly, so that I can efficiently manage workflows and monitor executions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL provide a navigation menu
2. WHEN a user clicks navigation items THEN the system SHALL route to appropriate sections
3. WHEN a user is on any page THEN the system SHALL highlight the current section
4. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL use responsive design for different screen sizes
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI to integrate with existing Strøm server APIs, so that all functionality works with the current backend implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the UI makes API calls THEN the system SHALL use the existing server endpoints
2. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL handle them according to current formats
3. WHEN WebSocket connections are needed THEN the system SHALL connect to existing WebSocket endpoints
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use the current JWT implementation
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle API error responses appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be modern and intuitive, so that I can efficiently interact with the platform without extensive training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interacts with the UI THEN the system SHALL provide consistent styling using TailwindCSS
2. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN the UI renders THEN the system SHALL follow modern React best practices
