# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the task list and individual task view pages in the Str√∏m application to provide more informative and useful interfaces for users managing workflow tasks. Currently, the task list only shows basic task names and descriptions, while the task view provides limited context about task execution history and configuration details. This enhancement will provide richer information display, better navigation, and improved user experience for task management workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Task List Display

**User Story:** As a workflow administrator, I want to see comprehensive task information in the task list, so that I can quickly assess task status and recent activity without navigating to individual task pages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the task list THEN the system SHALL display task name, last execution timestamp, status, and who triggered the last execution
2. WHEN a task has recent job executions THEN the system SHALL display the most recent execution timestamp and status indicator
3. WHEN a task has no execution history THEN the system SHALL display "Never executed" status
4. WHEN viewing the task list THEN the system SHALL support sorting by name, last execution timestamp, and status
5. WHEN viewing the task list THEN the system SHALL support server-side pagination with configurable page sizes
6. WHEN navigating through task pages THEN the system SHALL maintain sort order and provide page navigation controls

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Task Detail View

**User Story:** As a workflow operator, I want to see detailed task configuration and execution history in the task view, so that I can understand task dependencies, monitor performance, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a task detail page THEN the system SHALL display complete task metadata including description, input parameters with types and defaults, and flow step configuration
2. WHEN viewing task flow steps THEN the system SHALL display step dependencies, actions, and error handling configuration in a visual format
3. WHEN viewing task execution history THEN the system SHALL show execution statistics including success rate, average duration, and failure patterns
4. WHEN a task has input parameters THEN the system SHALL display parameter documentation, validation rules, and example values
5. WHEN viewing task dependencies THEN the system SHALL show which other tasks or resources this task depends on
6. WHEN viewing recent executions THEN the system SHALL provide quick access to job details and logs
7. WHEN viewing task execution history THEN the system SHALL support server-side pagination for job lists
8. WHEN navigating through job history pages THEN the system SHALL maintain filtering and sorting preferences

### Requirement 3: Task Performance Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to see task performance metrics and trends, so that I can optimize workflow efficiency and identify problematic tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing task details THEN the system SHALL display execution statistics including total runs, success rate, and average execution time
2. WHEN a task has multiple executions THEN the system SHALL show execution trend data over time
3. WHEN viewing task performance THEN the system SHALL highlight tasks with high failure rates or long execution times
4. WHEN comparing task performance THEN the system SHALL provide relative performance indicators compared to similar tasks
5. WHEN viewing execution patterns THEN the system SHALL show peak usage times and frequency distribution

### Requirement 4: Improved Task Navigation and Actions

**User Story:** As a workflow user, I want intuitive navigation and quick actions in the task interface, so that I can efficiently manage and execute tasks without unnecessary clicks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the task list THEN the system SHALL provide quick action buttons for running tasks directly from the list
2. WHEN viewing task details THEN the system SHALL offer breadcrumb navigation and related task suggestions
3. WHEN managing tasks THEN the system SHALL provide bulk actions for multiple task selection
4. WHEN viewing task execution history THEN the system SHALL offer quick filters and search functionality
5. WHEN navigating between tasks THEN the system SHALL maintain context and provide back/forward navigation
6. WHEN viewing task details THEN the system SHALL provide shortcuts to related jobs, logs, and configuration

### Requirement 5: Server-Side Pagination and Performance

**User Story:** As a user working with large datasets, I want efficient pagination for task and job lists, so that I can navigate through large amounts of data without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing task lists with many tasks THEN the system SHALL implement server-side pagination with configurable page sizes (10, 25, 50, 100 items)
2. WHEN viewing job history with many executions THEN the system SHALL implement server-side pagination for job lists
3. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL maintain current sort order, filters, and search criteria
4. WHEN loading paginated data THEN the system SHALL display total count, current page, and total pages
5. WHEN changing page size THEN the system SHALL remember the preference for the user session
6. WHEN paginating large datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain fast response times under 2 seconds

### Requirement 6: Enhanced Visual Design and Usability

**User Story:** As any user of the system, I want a visually appealing and intuitive task management interface, so that I can work efficiently without confusion or visual strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing task information THEN the system SHALL use consistent visual hierarchy and typography
2. WHEN displaying task status THEN the system SHALL use clear color coding and iconography
3. WHEN viewing complex task data THEN the system SHALL organize information using cards, tabs, and progressive disclosure
4. WHEN interacting with task elements THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate hover states and loading indicators
5. WHEN viewing the interface on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability
6. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL follow accessibility guidelines for keyboard navigation and screen readers
