# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the Str√∏m UI application from using Flowbite Svelte components to custom-built UI components. The migration will be performed incrementally, starting with the login screen and dashboard, then moving to task lists, task views, and job views. The goal is to maintain all existing functionality while using our own component library that follows atomic design principles and supports Svelte 5.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace Flowbite components with custom UI components so that we have full control over the design system and reduce external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL function identically to the current implementation
2. WHEN custom components are used THEN they SHALL follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates)
3. WHEN components are implemented THEN they SHALL be compatible with Svelte 5 syntax and features
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN Flowbite dependencies SHALL be removed from package.json

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the login screen to work exactly as before so that I can authenticate without any disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the login page THEN I SHALL see the same visual layout and functionality
2. WHEN I enter credentials THEN the authentication process SHALL work identically
3. WHEN there are authentication errors THEN error messages SHALL display properly
4. WHEN multiple authentication providers are available THEN I SHALL be able to access all options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard to display correctly so that I can navigate the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the layout SHALL render properly with custom components
2. WHEN I interact with navigation elements THEN they SHALL function as expected
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN custom components SHALL support both light and dark modes
4. WHEN I resize the browser THEN the layout SHALL remain responsive

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate components incrementally so that the application remains functional throughout the process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating a component THEN existing functionality SHALL not be broken
2. WHEN a component is migrated THEN it SHALL be thoroughly tested before proceeding
3. WHEN issues are found THEN they SHALL be resolved before moving to the next component
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all Flowbite imports SHALL be removed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want custom components to be properly typed and documented so that they are maintainable and reusable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript interfaces
2. WHEN components are implemented THEN they SHALL follow accessibility best practices
3. WHEN components are built THEN they SHALL support all necessary props and variants
4. WHEN components are completed THEN they SHALL be consistent with the existing design system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want task and job management interfaces to work seamlessly so that I can manage workflows effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view task lists THEN they SHALL display correctly with custom components
2. WHEN I view individual tasks THEN all form elements and interactions SHALL work properly
3. WHEN I view job details THEN all data SHALL be presented clearly
4. WHEN I interact with tables and forms THEN they SHALL respond appropriately
