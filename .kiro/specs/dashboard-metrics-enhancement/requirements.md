# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current dashboard lacks meaningful metrics and insights that would help users monitor and understand their workflow orchestration platform. This feature will transform the dashboard into a comprehensive monitoring and analytics center that provides real-time and historical insights into job execution, system performance, and workflow health.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to see system-wide performance metrics on the dashboard, so that I can monitor the overall health and performance of the orchestration platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display current system status including active workers, total jobs executed today, and system uptime
2. WHEN monitoring platform health THEN the system SHALL display the number of active/idle workers and their current workload distribution
3. WHEN checking system performance THEN the system SHALL show average job execution time over the last 24 hours
4. IF there are system alerts or warnings THEN the system SHALL prominently display them with appropriate severity indicators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a workflow manager, I want to see job execution statistics and trends on the dashboard, so that I can understand workflow performance patterns and identify bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing job statistics THEN the system SHALL display total jobs executed, success rate, and failure rate for the current day
2. WHEN analyzing job trends THEN the system SHALL show a time-series chart of job executions over the last 7 days
3. WHEN monitoring job performance THEN the system SHALL display average, minimum, and maximum job execution times
4. WHEN checking job status distribution THEN the system SHALL show a breakdown of jobs by status (running, completed, failed, queued)
5. WHEN identifying problematic workflows THEN the system SHALL highlight workflows with the highest failure rates
6. IF there are currently running jobs THEN the system SHALL display their progress and estimated completion times

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to see recent activity and alerts on the dashboard, so that I can quickly respond to issues and monitor current operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring recent activity THEN the system SHALL display a real-time feed of the last 10 job executions with their status and duration
2. WHEN checking for issues THEN the system SHALL show recent failures with error summaries and quick access to detailed logs
3. WHEN viewing system alerts THEN the system SHALL display critical alerts including worker disconnections, failed authentications, and resource exhaustion
4. WHEN monitoring current operations THEN the system SHALL show currently running jobs with progress indicators and estimated completion times
5. IF there are scheduled jobs THEN the system SHALL display the next 5 upcoming scheduled executions
